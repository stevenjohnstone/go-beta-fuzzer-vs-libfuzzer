# Comparing Go Fuzz Beta with Libfuzzer

The Go [native fuzzing beta](https://blog.golang.org/fuzz-beta) uses instrumentation
which is identical to the "libfuzzer" build mode. This allows direct comparison of
the mutation engines of the beta fuzzer and libfuzzer.

Note: applies to go version devel go1.17-7b6893d2d2 Mon Aug 23 20:58:28 2021 +0000 linux/amd64

## Technical Details

When using libfuzzer, integer comparison feedback is [wired up](https://golang.org/src/runtime/libfuzzer.go)
which gives it a slight edge over the beta fuzzer. In the simple test case here, using
the functionality is disabled (with the -use_cmp=0 flag).

https://github.com/stevenjohnstone/go114-fuzz-build is used to build an archive with libfuzzer instrumentation and
a ```LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput``` harness. This is a branch of https://github.com/mdempsky/go114-fuzz-build with a
command line flag added to specify the go compiler. Here, the dev.fuzz branch of golang is used with gotip.


## Usage

Build the container:

```
$ docker build -t fuzztests .
```

There are four tests:

Non-looping (```magic``` in [fuzz.go](/fuzz.go))
```
docker run --rm fuzztests mage libfuzzer
docker run --rm fuzztests mage betafuzzer
```
which run the libfuzzer and beta fuzzer tests, respectively.


Looping (```loopmagic``` in [fuzz.go](/fuzz.go))
```
docker run --rm -e FUZZ_FUNC=FuzzLoop fuzztests mage libfuzzer
docker run --rm -e FUZZ_FUNC=FuzzLoopBeta fuzztests mage betafuzzer
```


## Example Results

To run libfuzzer
```
$ docker run --rm fuzztests mage libfuzzer

## Looping and the Beta Fuzzer
Finding crashers with a simple loop appears to be about similar in performance between libfuzzer and beta fuzzer.

## Results

When trying to find inputs to ```magic``` which result in a return value ```true``` and cause a crash,  libfuzzer consistently finds a crasher in a couple of seconds with ~100000 executions. The number of executions required for the beta fuzzer
to find the crasher appears to be >= 100x that of libfuzzer.

When using ```loopmagic```, it appears that libfuzzer can find a crasher but the beta fuzzer cannot.


## TODO

* more comparison tests
* perform more runs to get an idea of the average executions required to complete tests
* run libfuzzer tests with [integer comparison feedback](https://llvm.org/docs/LibFuzzer.html#id32): maybe useful to add to the beta fuzzer?
